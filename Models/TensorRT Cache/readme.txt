The cache for TensorRT is built for the
specific model and GPU you are using
please, remove the files when changing
any of those.

If you have not use TensorRT this folder should be empty.
The first time you use this execution provider,
it will take a little longer to optimize the models,
after that, the cache will be automatically stored for
faster next runs of the programm.
